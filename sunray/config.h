Adafruit Grand Central M4 NOTE: You have to add SDA, SCL pull-up resistors to the board 
and deactivate Due clone reset cicuit (JP13):
https://wiki.ardumower.de/index.php?title=Ardumower_Sunray#Adafruit_Grand_Central_M4
NOTE: If you get compilation errors with Adafruit Grand Central M4, you may have to downgrade 'Adafruit SAMD Boards' to version to 1.7.5.

Arduino Due UPLOAD NOTE:  

If using Arduino Due 'native' USB port for uploading, choose board 'Arduino Due native' in the 
Arduino IDE and COM port 'Arduino Due native port'. 

If using Arduino Due 'programming' USB port for uploading, choose board 'Arduino Due programming' in the 
Arduino IDE and COM port 'Arduino Due programming port'. 

Also, you may choose the serial port below for serial monitor output (CONSOLE).
